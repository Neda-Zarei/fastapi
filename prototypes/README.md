# param_functions.py Refactoring Prototypes

This directory contains proof-of-concept prototypes for refactoring `fastapi/param_functions.py`.

## Prototype Files

1. **approach1_shared_types.py** - Shared Type Constants approach
   - Extracts parameter definitions to shared Annotated types
   - Tests: Path, Query, Body functions

2. **approach2_hybrid.py** - Hybrid with Function-Specific Overrides approach
   - Common parameters extracted, function-specific params remain in signatures
   - Tests: Path, Query, Header functions

3. **approach3_internal_helpers.py** - Internal Helper Functions approach
   - Extracts shared implementation logic to helper functions
   - Maintains full public function signatures unchanged
   - Tests: Path, Query, Body functions

## Testing Notes

Each prototype demonstrates the pattern with 2-3 functions to validate:
- IDE tooltip visibility
- Type checking compatibility (mypy strict mode)
- Code organization and readability
- LOC reduction potential

## Results

See `docs/refactoring/prototype_comparison.md` for detailed comparison.
See `docs/refactoring/approach_recommendation.md` for final recommendation.
